# Sanctuary
## (Acoustic Version)

**Tuning: Drop C**

**(Verse 1)**
*(A single, melancholic guitar chord rings out, then a gentle, repetitive fingerpicking pattern begins. The voice is soft, a whisper, almost resigned.)*
My chair sits empty, the canvas stark
Just inches away, a flickering spark
A silent promise, a world I could grasp
But this living room's pull, a numbing clasp

**(Chorus)**
*(The strumming gets a little more urgent, the voice rises in a restrained but pained harmony, hinting at a breaking point.)*
Oh, this house, no sanctuary, just a battlefield
Every whisper, a wound, a truth unrevealed
I crave the silence, a fragile, fleeting peace
To break these walls down, find my own release

**(Verse 2)**
*(The guitar returns to the quiet fingerpicking, but with a bit more complexity and a sense of tired reflection. The voice is filled with a weary honesty.)*
I made my promise, with a heart full of hope
Believed in a sunrise, on a fading slope
Now every sunrise, my purpose is chained
My passions are silenced, my sanctuary stained

**(Chorus)**
*(The strumming intensifies, a second guitar line could come in with a higher, melodic counterpoint, echoing the vocal melody. The voice is more forceful, a raw cry of frustration and desperate longing.)*
Oh, this house, no sanctuary, just a battlefield
Every whisper, a wound, a truth unrevealed
I crave the silence, a fragile, fleeting peace
To break these walls down, find my own release

**(Bridge)**
*(The music softens, a single, sustained chord holds, creating a space for vulnerability. The voice is full of raw emotion, a fragile hope barely holding on.)*
I only needed solace, a hand reaching out
Not this echoing silence, this perpetual doubt
Just a breath to remember, a world to ignite
To forge the horizon, bathed in my own light

**(Outro)**
*(The music fades, one last slow strum of a chord, resonant and lingering. The voice returns to a whisper, a promise to himself, a definitive and quiet resolve.)*
I'll wait on this couch, until the breaking dawn
Then I'll seize that threshold, and finally be gone

*(A final, clean guitar note rings out and fades to silence, leaving a sense of lingering tension and quiet determination.)*
