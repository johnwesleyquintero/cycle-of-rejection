1.  **Primary Goal:** State the main objective clearly at the top.
2.  **Artist & Genre Influence:** Name the primary artist and genre. Mention specific albums or sounds if possible.
3.  **Mood & Emotion:** Describe the feeling of the song. Use evocative adjectives.
4.  **Instrumentation & Tone:** Detail every instrument, its tuning, its specific sound, and its role in the song.
5.  **Song Structure & Dynamics:** Lay out the song's sections (verse, chorus, etc.) and describe the energy level and arrangement for each part. This is crucial for capturing dynamic shifts.
6.  **Tempo & Rhythm:** Specify the BPM (beats per minute) or provide a general tempo (e.g., mid-paced, slow, driving). Describe the rhythmic feel.
7.  **Vocal Style (if applicable):** Describe the desired vocal delivery and emotion.

### **Ready-to-Use Prompt for Producer AI to Create "Sanctuary"**

Here is a detailed prompt constructed from your data. You can copy and paste this into your chosen Producer AI platform.

**Prompt:**

**Primary Goal:** Generate a full-length acoustic song titled "Sanctuary" based on the provided lyrics. The song must be heavily inspired by the musical style of the band Saosin, specifically their dynamic, emotional, and layered acoustic performances.

**Core Influence:**
*   **Primary Artist:** Saosin
*   **Vocal Influence:** Anthony Green
*   **Genre:** Acoustic, Post-Hardcore, Emo, Alternative Rock

**Overall Mood & Emotion:** Introspective, melancholic, emotionally turbulent, vulnerable, and ultimately hopeful. The song should feel like a journey from a confined, suffocating space to a moment of release.

**Instrumentation & Tone:**
*   **Primary Instrument:** Acoustic Guitar 1.
    *   **Tuning:** Drop C (C-G-C-F-A-D). This is critical for the low-end, heavy feel.
    *   **Tone:** Warm, rich acoustic tone with a slight amount of natural overdrive or compression. It should sound organic, not like a clean electric guitar.
*   **Secondary Instrument:** Acoustic Guitar 2.
    *   **Role:** Plays counter-melodies that weave in and out of the main guitar part, especially during the choruses and bridge. The melodies should add harmonic layers and occasional subtle dissonance to heighten emotional tension.
*   **Percussion:** Very subtle and tasteful.
    *   **Elements:** Use light finger snaps, a shaker, or soft taps on the guitar body during verses. Introduce a single, soft tambourine hit on beat 2 of the chorus for accent. Avoid a full drum kit.
*   **Bass:** No traditional bass guitar. The low end should come from the Drop C tuned acoustic guitars.

**Song Structure & Dynamics:**
*   **Tempo:** Mid-paced, approximately 130-140 BPM.
*   **Introduction:** A few seconds of the main fingerpicked riff from Verse 1, setting a quiet, introspective tone.
*   **Verse 1:** Quiet and sparse. The main guitar should be fingerpicked. The vocals should be delivered in a restrained, almost-spoken style. Percussion should be minimal or absent.
*   **Chorus:** The energy must lift significantly. Both guitars should come in with rhythmic, driving strumming patterns. The vocals should become powerful, full-voiced, and emotional. The tambourine hit should accent the rhythm here.
*   **Verse 2:** Return to the quiet, introspective feel of Verse 1, but perhaps with a bit more rhythmic intensity from the fingerpicking to build anticipation.
*   **Chorus:** Repeat with the same high-energy, emotional dynamic.
*   **Bridge:** The most vulnerable part of the song. The music should become very sparse. Have the main guitar play single, ringing notes. The second guitar plays a hesitant, melancholic counter-melody. The vocals should be almost a whisper.
*   **Outro:** Start quietly, mirroring the end of the bridge. Then, build in volume and intensity. The final lines should be delivered with a sense of catharsis and determination, with both guitars strumming powerfully before fading out on a final, resonant chord.

**Vocal Style:**
*   **Delivery:** Must mimic the dynamic range of Anthony Green. Verses should be low and intimate. Choruses should be high, powerful, and carry a sense of emotional strain and release. The bridge should be breathy and vulnerable.

**Lyrics:**

**(Title: Sanctuary)**

**(Verse 1)**
Cracked porcelain moon, hangs heavy in the haze
Where dust motes dance in silence, lost in yesterday's maze
Empty coffee cups, like ghosts of conversations past
This hollow sanctuary, a promise built to never last

**(Chorus)**
These walls, they breathe with shadows, choke the fading light
A silent scream echoes, swallowed by the endless night
This fragile peace I crave, a phantom in the dust
This suffocating silence, a bitter, broken trust

**(Verse 2)**
I built these walls so high, to keep the darkness out
But shadows crept through cracks, and consumed every single doubt
Now the sunrise bleeds through windows, a promise left undone
This gilded cage I built for two, has a populace of one.

**(Chorus)**
These walls, they breathe with shadows, choke the fading light
A silent scream echoes, swallowed by the endless night
This fragile peace I crave, a phantom in the dust
This suffocating silence, a bitter, broken trust

**(Bridge)**
Just a flicker of a memory, a hope to be reborn
The phantom of a hand to hold, a voice to weather the storm
But only echoes answer, in this forgotten space
This hollow shell of a life, lost without a trace

**(Outro)**
I'll watch the dawn break grey, then tear these walls apart
And walk into the sunrise, with a hollow in my heart.
