# Breaking The Cycle - EP

![](5.png)

## The Concept

- **Band:** CYCLE OF REJECTION
- **EP Title:** Breaking The Cycle
- **Genre:** Christian Metalcore
- **Core Theme:** This EP is the sonic manifestation of the battle described in The Scholar's Codex. It is a four-part journey through the process of acknowledging one's demons—the scars left by a broken system—and then consciously deciding not to drown them, but to swim with them. Each track represents a different demon being harnessed and transformed from a source of pain into a weapon of strategic power. This is the war hymn for every person who has been told they are a problem when, in fact, they are the solution.

## Tracks:

### 1. Advance Scout (The Cynic's Eyes).mp3

_(This track is about transforming the demon of **Cynicism**—the feeling that people can't be trusted—into a strategic filter. The music is fast, technical, and laced with a feeling of paranoid clarity.)_

### 2. The Forge (Anvil of Anger).mp3

_(This track is about transforming the demon of **Anger**—the rage from being undervalued and micromanaged—into a focused, creative fire. The music is relentlessly heavy, rhythmic, and powerful, like a hammer striking an anvil.)_

### 3. The Quartermaster (Never Unarmed Again).mp3

_(This track is about transforming the demon of **Betrayal**—the memory of having work and access stolen—into the cold discipline of building a "Private Arsenal." The music has a darker, more somber tone, but with a core of unbreakable, hardened resolve.)_

### 4. The Spymaster (A Colder War).mp3

_(This track is about transforming the demon of **Frustration**—the irritation with incompetence—into the sophisticated, strategic "Ego Management Layer." The music is more complex, with shifting time signatures, representing the intricate game of social engineering.)_

Enjoy the music!
